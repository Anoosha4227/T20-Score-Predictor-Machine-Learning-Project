# T20-Score-Predictor-Machine-Learning-Project
This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to predict the outcome of T20 cricket matches. 
**Key features of the notebook include:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing match data for training and testing machine learning models. 
**Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementation of models such as Linear Regression to predict outcomes. The performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error.
**Visualization:** Residuals vs Predicted Values plot generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the performance of the model.
**Python Libraries Used:**
**Pandas** for data manipulation.
**NumPy** for numerical computations.
**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
**Scikit-learn** for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in sports analytics. It is a useful reference for those interested in predictive modeling in the domain of sports.
